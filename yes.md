You're so hypnotizng<br/>Could you be the devil?<br/>Could you be an angel?<br/>Your touch magnetizing<br/>Feels like I am floating<br/>Leaves my body glowing

They say be afraid<br/>You're not like the others<br/>Futuristic lover<br/>Different DNA<br/>They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world<br/>A different dimension<br/>You open my eyes<br/>And I'm ready to go<br/>Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me<br/>Infect me with your loving<br/>Fill me with your poison<br/>Take me, ta-ta-take me<br/>Wanna be your victim<br/>ready for abduction

Boy, boy, you're an alien<br/>Your touch so foreign<br/>It's supernatural<br/>Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic<br/>Wanna feel your power
