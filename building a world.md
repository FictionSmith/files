Orbital period | 687 earth days 
Atmosphere | Carbon dioxide (no oxygen) 
Climate | Cold desert 80 degrees F (minus 60 degrees C)
Descriptive terrain | There are no plantlife which had use to be until it was destroyed, most of the surface of Akneria is very much like a desert, it is very rocky and sandy, however it is freezing cold, there are very small pockets o water along side underground seas where the Aknerians gather water to survive. There are volcanic plains and lava pit across the sands and a gigantic mega-volcano in Basile. | 
Native races | Aknerians, however there are several different sub races, many of them are physically different from one another and each have different unique attributes baste on their current lifefestyle (list of races comming soon). 
Native language | Aknerian 
Animals | There are very few animals still in existence, most of them I do not have the name yet for, but I am still working on this one. |
Plants | (okay because I really wanted to put this in) there were thick forest on Akneria, giant plants, such as ferns, flowers and even mushrooms, trees grew to be hundreds of feet tall, plants that glowed at night and plants that even eat Aknerians! 
Cities | Still currently working on the cities, however the capitol city, Basilia is the center of the last Aknerian Dynasty. 
Realms | Basile, which is the center and most powerful empire on the planet, there are no other current empires or kingdoms however there are small independent states and tribes in the outside lands that refuse to bow down to the Emperor. 
Curencey | Diamonds? hematite, phyllosilicates (clay minerals), goethite, jarosite, iron sulfate minerals, opaline silica, and gypsum.
Population | 3 billion, not a lot compared to what it was like before many of them died out because the lost of habitation, died of starvation or were massacred by Alpha..
