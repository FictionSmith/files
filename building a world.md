System  | Pheonix     
Moons | 5
Orbital period | 687 earth days 
Atmosphere | Carbon dioxide (no oxygen) 
Climate | Cold desert 80 degrees F (minus 60 degrees C)
Descriptive terrain | There are no plantlife which had use to be until it was destroyed, most of the surface of Akneria is very much like a desert, it is very rocky and sandy, however it is freezing cold, there are very small pockets of water along side underground seas where the Aknerians gather water to survive. There are volcanic plains and lava pit across the sands and a gigantic mega-volcano in Basile. | 
Native races | Aknerians, however there are several different sub races, many of them are physically different from one another and each have different unique attributes baste on their current lifefestyle (list of races comming soon). 
Native language | Aknerian 
Animals | There are very few animals still in existence, most of them I do not have the name yet for, but I am still working on this one. |
Plants | (okay because I really wanted to put this in) there were thick forest on Akneria, giant plants, such as ferns, flowers and even mushrooms, trees grew to be hundreds of feet tall, plants that glowed at night and plants that even eat Aknerians! 
Cities | Still currently working on the cities, however the capitol city, Basilia is the center of the last Aknerian Dynasty. 
Realms | Basile, which is the center and most powerful empire on the planet, there are no other current empires or kingdoms however there are small independent states and tribes in the outside lands that refuse to bow down to the Emperor. 
Curencey | Hematite, phyllosilicates (clay minerals), goethite, jarosite, iron sulfate minerals, opaline silica, and gypsum.
Population | 3 billion, not a lot compared to what it was like before many of them died out because the lost of habitation, died of starvation or were massacred by Alpha..

System  | Pheonix     
Moons | 2
Orbital period | 365 earth days  
Atmosphere | Nitrogen and oxygen 
Climate | Temperate seasonal climate 61 degrees F 
Descriptive terrain | Very much like earth, except there are no deserts, rainforest and very little tundra. Erathora is mostly made up of sea and the rest of it is land which contains seasonal forest, mountains, valleys and industrialized cities. | 
Native races | Erathorans (humans) they are a LOT smarter than you or me, they are more mature than an average human, they are very smart and have a sensability of patriotism towards their planet. |

Animals | Very much like earth, pets; dogs, horses. Wildlife; kangaroos, pandas, foxes, woodland like animals- bears, deer, elk, foxes, racoons, chipmunks, sea animals; dolphines, whales, sharks, fish, sea turtles, coral. I could go on and on about this.. |
Plants | Trees, oak trees, pine trees, tall trees, short trees, maple trees, cherry trees, old trees, young trees, willow trees, talking trees, creepy trees, tree houses, plants, flowers, not a whole lot because half the planet is industrialized. |
Cities | Northwind (kind of like the capital and center of Erathora)<br/>Bridgeheart (a sub city and also a borough of Northwind, most of it is an island) This is where my character Mayshin lives, Foundfront (lies in the east of the coast of the Dragonheart Sea)<br/>Reachland (kind of a hick town as its mostly less industrialized and more country like) Billy's grandparent's live there. |
Curencey | Emerald 
Population | About 5 billion and in the Central Province there's about a population of 300 million (almost the same equivalent as America) |
