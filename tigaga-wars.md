| War of 1812 (Thirty Years War)  | 8120-8150 | The reason it was called the war of 1812 was not because of the year but the code used to protect the human race from foreign invasions, which is exactly what the lemia tried doing again, however the lemia had no chance against the humans quickly and advancing technology. |
