However D.E.R.P. hid all files on this project from Intergalactic Federation and kept it as a top secret. <br/> As Eden's tissue from his bones was spliced into a tube, Eden was 'reborn!' however being himself, he went insane and escaped his lab where he was created and murdered several doctors and scientist. Eden began to terrorize the entire space station as many workers began to flee. The D.E.R.P. CEO ordered a full scale evacuation and everyone fled the station. Eden being angry and confused escaped the space station and fled through space. The Intergalactic Federation had no clue of the event, they didn't even know about D.E.R.P. to begin with. <br/> Eden returned to Dragorah, (now a mega-space station controled by the humans) Eden went to it and terrorized all human forces. The Intergalactic Federation had just been noticed the situation which they could not believe what had happened. Dragorah was quickly re-conquered by Eden and began to control it as his own spaceship. Eden threatened the Intergalactic Federation that he is the true Emperor of Dragorah, and Overlord of the Universe. Soon all of the planets such as Oceania, Erathora and Saintaints went to war with Eden as he began to create a cyborg-Dragorian army using the same technique the scientist used at D.E.R.P. <br/> As he began rebuilding his empire, Eden noticed everyone he knew was dead and propoganda and hsitory books written about Eden's death and legacy were a cultral 'thing'. the year was 3297 and humans have had most of the control of the entire galaxy. Eden banned anything that was to do with his death and defeat and began invading other planets one of them was Lavarkee. As the Intergalctic Federation was panicing, they called in the "Chronicles" a group of heroes dedicated in protecting the universe, Anthren, Mayshin, Aurora, Rubberdog and Tutrok. The team stood face to face against Eden as they battled on a planet called earth. Eden got his butt kicked by the Chronicles and Eden was forver a memory.. and Dragorah was blown up, but not by the Chronicles or the Galactic Fed, no it was destroyed by someone who also wanted control over the universe..
