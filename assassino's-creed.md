Aside from cars and machine guns, Another reason why I persoanlly think an Assassin's Creed set in modern times or during World War II is because of media, an Assassin's Creed game would not do well in an age of media, such as mass radio communication and television. If you were to assassinate someone it would reported all over the news and it would be very hard to lower your notarity as clear photos of your idenity would be revealed.
