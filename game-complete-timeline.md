| 2013 | Samples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo 
Entertainment, from their Montréal headquarters, to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate, the father 
of Haytham Kenway and the grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive 
feature film, but in reality, Abstergo—the Templars of the present time—are searching for a First Civilization structure known as the 
Observatory, and are using the memories of Edward Kenway to find it. |
