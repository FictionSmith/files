Welcome to your life<br/>There's no turning back<br/>Even while you sleep<br/>We will find you<br/>Acting on your best behavior<br/>Turn your back on mother nature<br/>Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design<br/>It's my own remorse<br/>Help me to decide<br/>Help me make the most of freedom and pleasure<br/>Nothing ever last forever<br/>Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light wont find you<br/>Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down<br/>When they do I'll be right behind you<br/>So glad we almost made it<br/>So sad we had to fade it<br/>Everybody wants to rule the-<br/>Everybody wants to rule the-<br/>Everybody wants to rule the world
