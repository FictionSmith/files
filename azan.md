Azan was discovered in 1843 by a human explorer Henry V. Kelvitch who was sailing to Basile and landed on an island completely uncivilized with thick jungles. As Kelvitch step foot on the island an angry native ran out of the jungle with a spear yelling "Azan" and Kelvitch died. Dr. Mootch who was Kelvitch's assistance, was inspired by the native's cry and named the island Azan, "meaning that angry natives with Spears live here."
