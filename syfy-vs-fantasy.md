Their way of explaining the impossible | *There is no explination to why it happened, by the laws of magic.*<br/>-anomynomus | *There is an explination, somehow.*<br/>-anomynomus
Setting | Set within a completely fictional world, with made up people, creatures and magical elements. Sometimes it can be set in the real world. | Usually set in the real/or fictional world, with technological advancements, usually can be set in the utopian/dystopian or apocalyptic future.
| Theme | Fantasy stories are usually based on legends, epics, fables or fairy tales that use the moral of a light vs darkness, good vs evil or heaven vs hell theme. Usually giving allegoric symbols to each characters who follow some kind of prophecy or destiny. | Science fiction is usually shrilled with unexpected mystery and wonder which makes the audience more curious with the plot rather then foreseeing future events.  
Superhero Genre | In most superhero movies you may assume that they are science fiction but most have lots of fantasy elements in them. The concept of a superhero being born with their powers is an example of fantasy superheros, examples such as *Superman*, *Batman*, *Thor* and the *X-Men* characters. | Sci-fi superheros have more explainable and reasonable with using their powers, and don't just shoot laser beams out of their eyes. Most of these type of superheros are not born with powers and instead are either infected by or gain their powers from a natural cause, examples such as *Spider-Man*, *Iron Man*, *Hulk*, and *Captain America*.

|Movie|Genre|Reason|
|---|---|---|
| War of the Worlds | Sci-Fi | Science fiction, Martians invade the planet earth with giant machines to destroy the human race after finding out that their weakness is bacteria for some unknownly reason, WoTW is definitely science fiction. |
| Lord of the Rings | Fantasy | Set in a completely fictionalized world, called Middle-earth, and several fantasy like elements such as hobbits, elves, dwarves and dragons, not to mention the use of magic and the power created from the ring itself. The whole prophecy of the ring to be destroyed, and Sauron being defeated (which he actually isn't physically defeated but ya know..) Other than that LoTR is definitely fantasy. |
| Star wars | Both | The reason Star wars is both because it includes both fantasy and science fiction elements in it, an example for being fantasy is the Jedi's and the Sith using the force and their lightsabers (which could also be sci-fi) the whole prophecy thing with Luke confronting Darth Vader and restoring balance to the force and peace to the galaxy is also fantasy, while some of the creatures, machines and things may not exist there are some more plausible things that are more sci-fi, such as space travel, alien life and machines helping and fighting along side their masters. |
